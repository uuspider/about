This page contains links for an introductory graduate course in Solid State physics room 309 Braunstein 1:00-1:50 (see the UC calendar for important dates). For a more complete description of the course, please see the course syllabus. All of the original material is copyrighted to prevent others from publishing it for profit. However, please feel free to use and distribute these course materials (profit free) to your students. Also, email submissions of solutions, chapters, revisions will be gladly accepted and posted on this site (especially those involving computer symbolic manipulation, simulations, and visualization). Presently, the notes and homework assignments are available for the first twelve chapters of the course. Homework solutions will only be posted for two weeks after their due dates; however, they are available by request to Professors at other Universities (please send a regular-mail request written on letterhead to Mark jarrell, Dept. of Physics and Atronomy, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge LA. Include your email address, and I will send you what I have). A public http subdirectory for each chapter can be accessed by clicking on the corresponding graphic. Each of these subdirectories contains at least four files:
